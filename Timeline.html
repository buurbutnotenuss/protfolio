                            <p>The life in secondary school is very weird and chaotic even for someone like me. I spent
                                first 3 years in <a href="https://ischool.vn/ischool-nha-trang/" target="_blank">Ischool</a>, a famous international school. Eventhough I almost have little
                                to
                                no affection for that school, I have to thanks due to the friends and English skills I
                                gained from studing there. I changed school in the last year and move to a public school
                                near my house.</p>

                                primary school is unforgettable to me and my family as well. This also marks my first

                                but then I eventually saw her as a friend again.</p>
